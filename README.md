# CIS3760 - Team 5

Our project leverages Next.js, for both its frontend and a serverless backend. React flow for graphing, neo4j for our database storage and a variety of AWS services. EC2, Amplify, Elasticache, EKS, Docker to name a few. Our project uses Jest, Playwright, Eslint and Cypress as forms of web scraping and unit testing to ensure a clean production build.

This project serves as a course management utility for University of Guelph Students. It includes a full catalog of all courses and programs, with their respective prerequisite trees available on tap to anyone. It also includes a degree planner feature for students who want to map out their degree programs, semester by semester.
