# CIS3760 - Team 5

This project serves as a course management utility for University of Guelph Students. It includes a full catalog of all courses and programs, with their respective prerequisite trees available on tap to anyone. It also includes a degree planner feature for students who want to map out their degree programs, semester by semester.

Our project leverages Next.js, hosted on an ECS cluster, for both its frontend and a API. React flow for graphing and Neo4j for our database storage. Our project uses Jest and Cypress as forms of web scraping and unit testing to ensure a clean production build.
