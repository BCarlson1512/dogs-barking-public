This framework is then applied to the following aspects of animal behaviour: foraging, anti-predator responses, sleep, sociality, mating, parental behaviour, play, dispersal and territoriality, animal intelligence, and behavioural pathologies.",

Does God exist or is belief in God merely a myth? In this course, we will take a historical approach to the central issues of philosophy by examining such questions as: What is the nature of reality (metaphysics)? What can we know (epistemology)? Do good and evil exist (ethics)? What is beauty (aesthetics)? Through the investigation of these timeless questions, we will participate in \"the great conversation\" that has shaped the world in which we live. This course continues the historical approach to the central problems of philosophy. Students will study the modern and more contemporary philosophers who have influenced our understanding of modernity. Beginning with Descartes, the Utilitarians will be studied.

Students develop work habits such as serving clients effectively, which make them an asset to the agency, and how to navigate moral, ethical, clinical, and political issues as they emerge in their placements. Students work as part of a team, and learn how to effectively use supervision. Agency field supervisors and faculty advisors may raise professional, ethical, attitudinal, and practical issues which they consider to be important for students to address.",

Engineering communications emphasize the visual form and span engineering drawings across a spectrum of engineering disciplines (2D and 3D, realistic and symbolic). Sketching and computer aided tools are both developed. Written communications (individual and team) focus on design. The practice of professional engineering, ethical principles and the engineer's role and obligations in society are all introduced. The coursework is team-based to reflect the practice of engineering and the character of the School of Engineering.",

There are occasional lectures and discussions to highlight particularly interesting observations of insects. Student evaluation is based on the student's insect collection and associated logbook, a written paper describing their experiment, contributions to class discussions and activities, and peer evaluation. The field site is generally in the USA or South America. Course fees cover costs of room, board, supplies, and transportation to the field site(s).
