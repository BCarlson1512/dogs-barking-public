      "description": "This introductory course provides an overview of  Canadian and global agri-food systems. Students  will be introduced to many different facets of  agriculture, including primary production  (conventional and organic) of commodity,  mid-value and high-value crops, and livestock.  Students will explore the agri-food system by  tracing consumer end-products back to primary  production. Modern, industrial agri-food systems  as well as subsistence farming will be discussed.  The course incorporates an experiential learning  component in which students will explore a new  agri-food opportunity for Ontario by designing  and assessing the value chain.
